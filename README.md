# SKETCH Your Initial on Graph Paper FIRST

Before you begin to code (or stop now if you have begun to code) you are required to sketch out ONE of your Initials on GRAPH PAPER before you continue to code. 

Include fill ( r, g, b) colors, remembering that the colors you use in your Initial have to be significant/meaningful to you in some way.

And at least one example of EACH function you intend to use. For example below I have written out quad(), line(), fill, noStroke, ellipse, etc.


# REQUIREMENTS 

Code TWO of your initials with the below requirements.

Your ‘sketch’ of your Initials must: 

3D
One of your Initial needs to be in 3D, like a block letter
Also check out dafont.com for different type styles
See my “V” below for an example

CURVY
One of your Initial needs to be curvy, utilizing the ellipse function in some way


QUAD
Use the new function “quad (x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4)” in at least one of your Initials


# COLORS
Please use colors that are significant/meaningful to you, I have used the colors of the Italian flag ( green, white, and red) because I am part Italian. You will explain later in your reflection how the colors are significant/meaningful to you.

# New! BACKGROUND DESIGN
Please create some sort of background design in one of your Initials. For my “V” initial, I have a dark grey background with different size white circles overlapping each other. The circles are filled with white but have a “opacity” of 70%, which makes them appear “see-through” when they overlap. The code is: fill(255, 255, 255, 70);, with 70 being the percentage of opacity. Try it.


# RESOURCES 
Some of this information will help you on your Initial. 

Use the following commands - where you need to figure out what numbers to plug in to get the desired behaviour: 

1. arc(x, y, width, height, radians(start angle), radians(end angle));

2. size(?, ?) 
3. quad (x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4)
4. rect (?, ?, ? , ?) ( x, y coordinates, width, height )
5. triangle (x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3)
6. ellipse(?, ?, ? , ?) ( x, y coordinates, width, height )





Note that when drawing a shape you can control some of its properties. 

# Commands that are useful are: 

• stroke(r, g, b); ( 0-255, 0-255, 0-255 )
• fill(r, g, b); for Opacity, or “see through” colors, add a percentage number after the (r, g, b, 50); 50=50% opacity, 90=90% opacity, etc.
• noStroke();



# NAMING Convention

“YOURFIRSTNAME(allcaps).Initials” 
“ _ “ Underscore in between words

You may code two separate Initials files, or code them both together.


# SAVE an image of your Initial 

Cut and Paste this function into the LAST line of your code to save an image ( .png file format ) to your sketch folder.


//save function
save(“YOURFIRSTNAME(allcaps).Initial.png");
